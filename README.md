This **Student Management System** project, implemented using a Bash script, provides functionalities for managing student records. It allows users to add, list, search, and delete student records, including subject marks and grades. The system features user authentication with predefined credentials, and calculates grades based on total marks. It uses arrays to store student details such as roll numbers, names, subject marks, and grades. The system also incorporates color-coded outputs for a more user-friendly experience.

Key functionalities:
- **Authentication:** Ensures access with username and password validation.
- **Add Student:** Allows adding new student records with marks for multiple subjects (Operating System, ANN, German, Data Mining, Machine Learning, KRR).
- **List Students:** Displays all students with their marks and grades.
- **Search Student:** Allows searching by roll number to view specific student details.
- **Delete Student:** Provides the option to remove student records by roll number.

The grades are determined based on total marks using predefined thresholds, and results are stored and displayed interactively, ensuring easy management of student data.
